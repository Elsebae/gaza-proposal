üåç Technical Proposal: Smart Urban Rebuilding for Gaza Using NASA Earth Observation Data
1. Executive Summary
Our project is a frontend-only website that highlights strategies for rebuilding Gaza after the war using NASA Earth observation data. The site will showcase the city‚Äôs environmental conditions before and after the war, focusing on air quality, water resources, and agriculture. Through articles, videos, graphs, and photos, we will identify the main problems Gaza faces and propose data-driven solutions that support sustainable urban planning.
2. Introduction and Background
Gaza, heavily damaged by war, faces urgent challenges:
‚Ä¢	Air pollution worsened by destruction and lack of green space.
‚Ä¢	Water scarcity and contamination, threatening public health.
‚Ä¢	Agricultural loss, reducing food security and economic stability.
Urban planners, NGOs, and communities need reliable environmental data to rebuild effectively. NASA‚Äôs Earth science datasets provide exactly that‚Äîhelping identify vulnerabilities and design climate-smart solutions.
3. Problem & Proposed Solution
Problems
‚Ä¢	Rising air pollution and lack of green infrastructure.
‚Ä¢	Water stress due to damaged supply systems.
‚Ä¢	Agricultural decline and loss of fertile land.
Our Solution
We will develop a website that:
‚Ä¢	üìä Uses graphs to compare Gaza‚Äôs environment before and after the war.
‚Ä¢	üìñ Publishes articles explaining the challenges and solutions for air, water, and agriculture.
‚Ä¢	üé• Displays videos and photos to tell Gaza‚Äôs story visually.
‚Ä¢	üå± Offers data-driven recommendations for sustainable rebuilding.
This provides urban planners and communities with a quick, accessible, and engaging tool for decision-making.
4. Tools & Technologies
We will build the site using:
‚Ä¢	Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js optional if time allows).
‚Ä¢	Data Visualization: Chart.js or plain JS chart libraries for graphs.
‚Ä¢	Content: Articles, videos, and photos prepared for storytelling.
‚Ä¢	Deployment: GitHub Pages or Vercel for hosting.
5. Deliverables (Hackathon Scope)
By the end of the hackathon, we will deliver:
‚Ä¢	üåê A functional website with:
o	Home page with project introduction.
o	Three main sections: Air, Water, Agriculture.
o	Graphs comparing Gaza‚Äôs environment before and after war.
o	Articles with solutions informed by NASA data.
o	Media gallery (photos, sample video).
8. Conclusion & Call to Action
This project demonstrates how NASA Earth science data can be used to guide sustainable rebuilding in Gaza. By focusing on air, water, and agriculture, and presenting information through an engaging frontend website, we provide a practical, data-driven tool for urban planners, NGOs, and communities.
üëâ We invite judges, mentors, and partners to support expanding this prototype into a long-term platform for climate-resilient urban planning.
